\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{College Courses}
  These videos will try to cover few college courses. Namely those
  are Data Structures and Algorithms, OS or System Programming,
  Network Programming, Multithreaded Programming and Inter-Process
  Communication.

  Source of these slides can be found at
  https://github.com/shivshankardayal/Cpp-Code-Slides

\section{Analysis of Algorithms}
\subsection{Analysis of Algorithms}
\begin{frame}{Analysis of Algorithms}
  These will be done for individual data structures and algorithms.
  We are concerned with best-case, average case and worst case
  time and space complexities.

  Usually when you try to optimize then you will find that space
  and time complexities are a trade-off and you can improve both
  only by changing entire data structure or algorithm, for the
  problem in concern, entirely.

  I have already uploaded analysis of Algorithm video.
